Smaller projects and study notes I use to learn about NLP and transformers

 Attention search contains a script where I used BERT attention layers for similarity and word filtering. <br>
 It filters out nouns, stopwords and special characters to compare predefined seed words to individual tokens in a target sequence. <br>
 
 It is not a 100% reliable as it heavily relies on context.
